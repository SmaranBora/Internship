# Internship
I utilized the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm for detecting road signs on Indian roads. YOLO is an efficient and accurate deep learning model designed for object detection in real-time. The approach involved training the model with a dataset of Indian road signs, enabling it to recognize and classify different sign types with high precision.
